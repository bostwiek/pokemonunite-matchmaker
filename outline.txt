MAIN IDEA:
People open this webapp, and either with others, or by themselves, Join a group until 5 are partied. From there it assigns a GROUP ID for them to all type into their Unite games, and either assigns a discord link to chat from there
(could have free discord with 10 voice rooms, and it just sends a link to joins and says "Your voice lobby is #10")

someone connects to server, a session is started and a session token is assigned

session opts in or out of "I am okay with being the party leader" - requires text input of lobby ID

something should show people where to click to join a lobby, without being condescending
 "Where do I get my Lobby ID?" with help overlay?

click "Ready to party", sends request to server, server receives session ID and optional lobbyID from client, checks if there are any stacks with exactly [x] remaining slots that this party could fill

If not, looks all the way down (quick check here could save time - check if _any_ parties exist, and if not just create a new object key)

state object stores either an object of objects, or array of objects, and pushing users into and out of these

need something here to handle timeouts, like after everyone has joined a party the website confirms that you are in teh group now, and can close the browser/session
